This cheat is currently undetectable.
It works by editing value in memory that enables r_drawothermodels 2 like behaviour.

Memmory offsets for this change often, I will try to update the cheat within 1 day post update.

U need to install AHK in ANSI (32bit) mode, else the cheat won't work.

It's sourced from a cheating forum.
